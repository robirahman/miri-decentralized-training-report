**Subject:** Question regarding DiLoCo scaling constants for 10^26 FLOP regimes

Dear Arthur,

I have been following your work on DiLoCo and the more recent "Streaming DiLoCo" with great interest. I am currently building a decentralized training simulator designed to estimate the performance of multi-node clusters over WAN, specifically targeting massive-scale runs (up to 10^27 FLOPs).

Your research on local SGD and communication-efficient training forms the basis of our "Data Parallel" simulation mode. However, I am seeking to validate the efficiency coefficient (eta) we use to model algorithmic degradation as "Inner Steps" increase. 

Would you be open to a 15-minute call or a brief email exchange to discuss whether our current sensitivity assumptions for H (inner steps) align with the scaling laws you’ve observed in larger models?

Best regards,
