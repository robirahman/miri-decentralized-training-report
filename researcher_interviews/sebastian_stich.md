**Subject:** Theoretical convergence bounds for a Decentralized Training Simulator

Dear Sebastian,

I am developing a technical simulator that models the performance and feasibility of decentralized training for very large-scale models. A core component of the simulator is the mathematical modeling of Local SGD convergence rates.

I have been using your research on the fast convergence of Local SGD to justify our assumptions about synchronization frequency. I would be very grateful for a brief opportunity to show you our efficiency equations and ensure that the "weight divergence" penalties we've implemented are theoretically sound and consistent with your findings on communication-efficient optimization.

Would you be willing to provide a quick sanity check on our convergence logic?

Kind regards,

[Your Name]
