Hi Johannes,

Big fan of what you're building at Prime Intellect. The INTELLECT-1 report and the SPES protocol have been key resources for a decentralized training simulator I'm currently building.

While many papers focus on theory, I’m trying to make this simulator as "real-world" as possible. I would love to ask you about the empirical Model FLOP Utilization (MFU) you've seen in the wild when training across regional data centers, and how you handle the trade-off between FP8 precision and communication volume in practice.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about the practical hardware bottlenecks you've encountered? I'd love to ensure our simulator reflects the actual engineering hurdles of "over-the-internet" training.

Best,

[Your Name]
